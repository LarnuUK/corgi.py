Welcome to the Warmachine and Hordes Virtual Team Championship Discord server!

**Getting Started:**
As a new user, you may have limited access to the server's channels. This is by design, so don't worry if you can't see the majority of text and voice channels. Once you are given your applicable role(s) you'll be able to access any of the channels you need, and be able to send message/speak in them. Once an event has ended, the channels will be opened back up to everyone.

Please do ensure you change your nickname in the server to be representative of the name you use on Conflict Chamber, or your real name. This makes everyone's lives easier and it means that all parties can identify others easily. Introducing yourself is normal in real life, so just see changing your nickname to your real name as the same. :) Users that don't change their nickname may have their nickname forcibly changed.

If you're a Team Member, then please contact your Team Captain, who can add you to the team's role. You'll then gain access to all the channels you need.

If you're a Team Captain, Judge, or Streamer, please ping to VTC Committee (or myself) and we'll get you set up. As a Team Captain, please familiarise yourself with the bot commands in #bot-help.

Speaking of bots, @Corgi is our "resident" bot here. All role maintenance and permissions are managed by our good little doggo. If, however, he does start misbehaviouring please ping me, and I'll give him a few treats and get him behaving again.

**FAQs**:
> 1. Why so many table categories and channels?
The server is designed to be able to host up to 32 teams. That means 16 team games at a time, and each of those will have 10 players playing each other, making for 5 games in each team game. Opponents having their own Voice Channel is important, to avoid confusing, so we needed at most 80 voice channels for the games. The games each also have their own text channel, which **must** be used for sharing the War Table link. This allows your opponent to easy find the game, and as well as any judges and streamers. You can condense the table categories using the cevron adjacent to them, to reduce the "noise".

> 2. I can't find my Team's Text/Voice Channel
The team Text/Voice Channels are at the bottom of all the channels, below the tables. 

> 3. Can users not in a Team access the game channels?
No. Only users with roles can access the game channels. A user without any roles can see the Table's chat and talk channels only. They can connect to the voice channel, but not talk, and can read the text channel but not send messages. Streamers can view all the game channels, and connect to the voice channels, but cannot communicate in them.

> 4. I'm a Team Captain, (Head) Judge or Streamer, how do I get my role?
Please ping the VTC Committee, or myself, and we can give you the role.

> 5. I'm a Team Captain, but the VTC Committee didn't create my Team's role, or add my other team members?
Captains manage their own teams. Corgi will have DM'd you when you were given the role with instructions. You can also review #bot-help if get stuck

> 6. I'm a Team Member, how do I get my team's role?
Please contact your Team Captain, who can give you the role.

> 7. How do my Team Members join the server?
Please use the same invite link you were given to join the server. @Corgi will have also DM'd you the link.

-----

> 8. I'm a streamer, can I get a webhook?
Yes. Streamers have permission to add their webhooks to the #streams . The webhooks will be removed at the end of the tournament. Please do not use it for webhooks other than streams that will cast the games here (these will be removed along with your @Streamer role).

> 9. I'm not a member of a team, can I still use the server to play games?
Sure! During an event, the tables will be inaccessible to non-team users, however, you'll still be able to access the Casual Games Category. Feel free to use those at any time.

> 10. Does Corgi log any of our details?
The only logs Corgi keeps are logs of commands you use in this server. When you use a command that effects a user or role (such as adding a user to a role, or changing your team's colour) Corgi will log this, along with your nickname, ID, and the time of your action. 

> 11. Corgi isn't working properly, what do I do?
If Corgi is "misbehaving" please give me (Thom) a ping. If he's offline I'll give him a (metaphoric) kick, and if it's a behaviour "feature" I'll do my best to fix it promptly. Of course, any "user errors" will receive the appropriate level of mocking. ;) If you're after a new feature, please instead raise this as an issue on my Github (see `$GitHub`). Thanks.
