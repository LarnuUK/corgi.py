*Other markdown files are written in Discord Markdown, which does not quite follow the normal standards. These will not format correctly on GitHub, however, will show correctly in Discord. They are designed to be pasted into and display correctly on Discord, not display properly here, so formatting issues on for how they appear on GitHub will not be address.*
